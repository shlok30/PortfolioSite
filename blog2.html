            <p>Lets be honest, this question has haunted all of us at some point. We humans are very good at making <strong>New Year's Resolutions</strong> and <strong>Bucket Lists</strong> but its the execution where we fail</p>
            <p>Sometimes our innate laziness becomes our biggest enemy or in some cases life just happens and we are forced to change the direction in which we are heading</p>
            <p>So should we go back and explore our passion or maybe pick up a new skill at a later point in our life?</p>
            <p>Well the answer to this question is <strong>yes</strong></p>
            <p>Because no matter what phase of your life you are in, if you don't follow your passion you will always be regretful and regret is a slow poison that mentally weakens you</p>
            <p>Yes, the beginning phase of learning a new skill might be very cumbersome and frustrating but if you stick with it and somehow start enjoying the process of learning, you'll be surprised at how fast you will start improving and reach closer to your goal</p>
            <p>Whenever you feel frustrated and feel like quiting, always remember why you started in the first place because if your <strong>WHY</strong> is strong then it'll always guide you back</strong></p>
            <p>So go and start learning how to code, pick up that instrument you always wanted to learn, go and build that dream physique or finally learn how to drive </p>
            <p>Because maybe the best time to have picked up these skills was 10 years ago but the second best time is <strong>NOW</strong></p>
